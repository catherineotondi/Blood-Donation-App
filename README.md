# BLOOD DONATION WEB APPLICATION
Emergencies especially in hospitals where a patient 
requires blood transfusion and there is incompatibility 
or lack of one to donate mostly results to death.
This is a web application that is geared to aid hospitals
 in accessing blood donation details of various volunteers
  who use this application to provide information.
